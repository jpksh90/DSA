        "Programming languages are tools to give instructions to the computer. Computer only understand binary code which is difficult for human to read. A computer program is written in the human-readable characters. A software called as a compiler or interpeter tranlates the program to binary code for execution by computer. The human readable version is called as source code while the binary is called as machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This translation is done in two ways. One, it can translate each line of the source code into the machine code and give it immediately to the computer for executing it. This is called as an interpreter. Otherwise, it translates the whole program to a binary file. This is called as a compiler. Another popilar approach is to compile the program an intermediate language. This code in intermediate language can later be translated to machine code by the interpreter. Such interpreters are called just-in-time interpreter. As of now, fully interpreted languages are a thing of the past. Nowadays, either we have a compiled language or a just-in-time interpreted language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The language we are going to use is Python which is compiled and interpreted language. A python program file is first converted to the compiled python bitcode, which is intepreted by the python interpreter.\n",

        "\n",
        "To write a python script, you need a text editor and a python interpreter. You can download the python interpreter from https://www.python.org/downloads/. I suggest to use Visual Studio Code for text editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/) which provides fantastic support for python. Another option is to use a Jupyter environment. Here, we will be using the python interpreter which is bundled with the Jupyter environment for ease of explanation. However, you are suggested to use the text editor and interpreter.\n",

If the dice roll turns out to be a even number the points are given to the opponent player. Otherwise, the player get the points equals to twice the dice roll. The player who reaches 100 points wins the game. Assume that you are given a function `dice_roll()` which returns the value of the current dice rolled."
