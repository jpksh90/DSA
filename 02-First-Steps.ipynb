    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are tools to give instructions to the computer. The program which is written in human readable format is called a source code. A software called as a compiler or interpreter and it translates the program to binary code (otherwise known as machine code) for execution by computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This translation is done in two ways. One way is to translate each line of the source code into the machine code and give it immediately to the computer for executing it. This is called as an interpreter. The other approach is to translate the whole program to a binary file. This is called as a compiler. Another popular approach is to compile the program an intermediate language. This code in intermediate language can later be translated to machine code by the interpreter. Such interpreters are called just-in-time interpreter. As of now, fully interpreted languages are a thing of the past. Nowadays, many languages allows us to either we have a compiled language or a just-in-time interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a compiled and interpreted language. A python program file is first converted to the compiled python bitcode, which is intepreted by the python interpreter. To write a python program, you need a text editor and a python interpreter. You can download the python interpreter from https://www.python.org/downloads/. I suggest to use Visual Studio Code for text editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/) which provides fantastic support for python. Another option is to use a Jupyter environment. Here, we will be using the python interpreter which is bundled with the Jupyter environment for ease of explanation. However, you are suggested to use the text editor and interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs are called as scripts. Each line in a script is a statement. Statements are executed sequentially, unless there is a case of a function or class. Generally, these cases are so common in programming, that it is customary to not assume that the scripts are executed sequentially. We will come to this case later in this chapter. But, for now assume that scripts are executed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programs introduced in the book are written in Jupyter notebooks. So, please run the code in Jupyter notebook for learning purposes as it provides a convenient interface to experiment which would otherwise be cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the reserved words which is understood by the Python interpreter and have a special meaning. The figure below shows the list of keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keyword | Keyword  | Keyword | Keyword  | Keyword |\n",
    "|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| False   | await    | else    | import   | pass    |\n",
    "| None    | break    | except  | in       | raise   |\n",
    "| True    | class    | finally | is       | return  |\n",
    "| and     | continue | for     | lambda   | try     |\n",
    "| as      | def      | from    | nonlocal | while   |\n",
    "| assert  | del      | global  | not      | with    |\n",
    "| async   | elif     | if      | or       | yield   |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input/Output\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to keywords, Python defines some function which have a special meaning. For now, assuming a function is set of instructions defined for a specific purpose. Two of these are `input` and  `print`. `print` display something to the screen. `input` function is used to take input from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce the first part of the code. In the first statement, it asks the name from the user and stores it in a variable (introduced in the next section). The input taken from the keyboard is always considered as a text, i.e., `11044` and  `this is a text` are both text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second statement, it displays the message on the screen. The text separated by comma are separated by space when displayed on the screen. The variable name is replaced by the value received as input from the user."

    "# Constants and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants, as the name indicates, are the values that do not change. Variables are the names which can hold constants or other variables. Variable is similar to the concept of a variable in school algebra books. The program below declares a variable *x* which is a name for the constant $5$. In this case, the python interpreter will create a memory location, named *x* and will write the value $5$ to that memory location. In the python interpreter, you can query for the value of the variable by writing the variable name. Go and run this code and see what it prints. Later, modify the value of x to $7$ and check whether it has changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names in Python are case-sensitive, i.e., `a` and `A` are not the same. It must start with a letter or an underscore and must contain alphanumeric characters or underscore. Keywords cannot be variable names. Variable names also cannot start with a number. It is conventional practice, to start local variable names with a lower-case alphabet."

    "Write the following programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute one of positive root (assume 0 to be a positive number) of a polynomial of degree 3. If the root does not exist between $(0, 10k)$, then it should return -1. Assume that the margin of error is given as input. By default, the error tolerance is $0.0001$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A popular yet simple to express conjecture in mathematics is collatz conjecture. Start with a number $n \\geq 1$, and form a sequence of the numbers by applying the function $f(n) = \\begin{cases} n/2 & \\mathit{n~is~even}\\\\ 3n+1 & \\mathit{n~is~odd}\\end{cases}$ at each step on the result from the previous step until it reaches 1. The conjecture is that the sequence will always end in 1 for any starting integer $n$. Verify collatz conjecture for $n$ from  0 to 1000. For example, starting with $5$, the sequence formed is $[16, 8, 4, 2, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend the square root method to compute the precise square root. Assume a margin of error tolerance to be $0.01$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Given three coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$,  $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_2, y_2)$. Check if these are colinear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Game of Dice: Two players takes turn to roll a dice. Each players get the points equal to the value of the dice roll. If the dice roll turns out to be a even number the points are given to the opponent player. Otherwise, the player get the points equals to twice the dice roll. The player who reaches 100 points wins the game. Assume that you are given a function `dice_roll()` which returns the value of the current dice rolled."
